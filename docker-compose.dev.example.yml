  # Note: two common dev options:
  # 1) Use Postgres running on your host machine (recommended for local dev)
  #    - Keep DATABASE_HOST=host.docker.internal in the `strapi` service env.
  #    - Start Postgres locally (outside Docker) and ensure it listens on 0.0.0.0
  #      or that Docker Desktop's host.docker.internal resolves to it.
  # 2) Run Postgres as a service inside this compose file (uncomment below).
  #    - Set DATABASE_HOST=postgres in the `strapi` env and uncomment the
  #      `postgres` service and the `volumes:` declaration at the bottom.

  # postgres:
  #   image: postgres:15-alpine

# If you enabled the postgres service above, uncomment the `volumes:` block
# below to persist DB data between runs. If you keep Postgres on the host,
# you don't need the `pgdata_dev` volume here.
